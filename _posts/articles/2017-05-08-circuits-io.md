I've always been intrigued with gadgets, and been a bit envious of people who could manipulate them to their will.

Who hasn't thought, how can I make that toy better? Well, now you can learn all the basics without actually soldering.

I bought [The Arduino Started Kit] and made a few of the little projects in there. Enough to whet my appetite.

However, you need lots of fiddly bits, and they are either expensive, or take ages to get here (Christchurch, NZ), and I'm not usually sure what I need, or how to use what I have.

So, I made a few of the projects using the breadboard, and altered them a bit to suite me.

For instance, who hasn't wanted to know the temperature in degrees Kelvin?

This however palled, and I was keen to start using bits I didn't have lying around, inline switches, 555-timers, a variety of leds, diodes, resistors and so on.

Enter [Autodesk Circuits]

This is a project from Autodesk, and allows you to create circuits on a breadboard, with unlimited tools at your disposal. You can blow up as many capacitors as you like, and they're all free.

I'm a big fan of kata's. The idea that you do the same thing often, anmd deliberately as a way of embedding learnings.

I have a kata now where I create a board with switches. This is how I do it:
 - clear my kata project
 - add breadboard, arduino, switches, resistors
 - join them all up
 - write the code
 - run it
 - debug it

This might seem simple and obvious but it takes into account many of the facets I need to worry about and learn.

I have tried a few more advanced projects, such as a 555-timer piano, but the wiring has defeated me thus far, but each time I try something, I get a little closer.
