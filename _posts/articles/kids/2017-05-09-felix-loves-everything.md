## Felix is loves eveything

So I met up with the kids for my birthday, at Scarborough Park.

It's my birthday. I never make a big thing about it, because it's too much trouble. I forget everyone elses, and I get annoyed with myself, so I kind of ignore my own.

Anyway, Angela, very kindly, and probably against her better judgement allowed me a special date with them, which means more than you can imagine, and her friend Lisa bought them down.

Felix and Ursula were in the car, and today was Felix's turn to talk. Usually it's Ursula, but she was a bit quieter and F was the talker, as I lifted them down.

Felix: "Happy birthday Dad. I love birthdays".

He says it in a way that doesn't imply he loves presents, or cake, or being the center of attention. He loves birthdays with a pure unadulterated love.

I have presents for them for their birthdays. I bought them a while ago, but they are indoor toys, and I donlt want to distract them. Nayway, it was their birthdays 6 weeks ago, and I was sick of carrying them around.

I gave them their presents, but they couldn't unwrap them 'til they got home. They wanted to know what they were. They both got Thomas the Tank Engines, and additional parts of the set.

Felix: "I love Thomas the Tank Engine". Spoken with a reverence that was almost religious. Not fevered, but with joy and wonder. And it wasn't that he was keen to open the present, because he wasn't, but the fact that he existed in a world that Thomas the Tank Engine existed was enough for him.

The sun has just come over the hill, and it's still a bit cool and the grass is wet, so we have coffee and fluffies first.

Felix: "Can I have a chocolate Fluffie? I love Chocolate Fluffies". Again, it's not like he loves them for the taste, or the smell, or the stickiness all over your face, the way they do when you're 3. It's a deep spiritual love, like a deserts love the rain, like the sky loves the earth.

We go down to the beach. I didn't bring spades or shovels, and the kids want to dig. But I don't want to send them back to Ange drenched in sand.

Felix: "I love shovels". Again, with both earnestness and contentment. This love is real, and it's a physical thing to him, like the sea.

We depart the beach, for lack of digging implements and head up to the park. It's a good park. A mixture of stuff that was old when Angela used to come here as a girl, a see-saw horse, a slide so high and tottery generations of kids must have broken limbs on, and newer safer, less fun, climbing frames.

Me (to the kids): What shall we go on?

Felix: "The horse. I love this horse". He talking about a metal see-saw horse. He's picturing a particular horse that's his spirit animal. He can feel the air rushing through his mane, and he loves horses like that horse loves the wind.

I wonder where he got his spirituality from, because it's definitely not from either of his parents.

Later on, Felix and Ursula are on the swings. I'm swinging both of them, one with each hand. Both of them wittering away.

I'm pushing him so high the seat drops a bit. I'm not pushing him higher than that. There's no need for him to break stuff as often as his Dad did.

Felix: "Push me higher Dad. With both hands. I love swings". It's almost scary the depth of feeling in those words. It's not really emphatic, but very emotional, and I feel his love.

They were on that swing for a half hour, but now it was time to go.

Me: "Good-bye Ursula, goodbye Felix, remember Daddy loves you very much"

Ursula: "I love you Daddy"

Felix: "I love you", but it was a bit more perfunctory. He might as well have said "I love your majesty / According to my bond, no more nor less."

Kids...

I wouldn't have a birthday any other way.
