## What goes into a finished app or JS app

1. EditorConfig

   [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/)

   Coding standards are pretty important. They give confidence of quality and prevent some hard to detect errors.

   Code modifiers use a variety of editors and a variety of environments, each with their own default editor configs.

   EditorConfig provides a standard that's supported by most code editors (VS, JetBrains...), and those that don't usually have plugins available.

   EditorConfig a standard for editors to define things like:
    - charset (utf-8, utf-16...)
    - end of line definition (lf, cr/lf, whatever)
    - end of file definition (empty line at end or not)

   That means whatever editor a code modifier might use, they'll have a fixed standard for what text files looks like. You can specify text standards based on file type.

   It's just a file called `.editorconfig` in the root of your project that looks something like:

   ```bash
   # EditorConfig is awesome: https://EditorConfig.org

   # top-most EditorConfig file
   root = true

   # Unix-style newlines with a newline ending every file
   [*]
   end_of_line = lf
   insert_final_newline = true

   # Matches multiple files with brace expansion notation
   # Set default charset
   [*.{js,py}]
   charset = utf-8

   # 4 space indentation
   [*.py]
   indent_style = space
   indent_size = 4

   # Tab indentation (no size specified)
   [Makefile]
   indent_style = tab

   # Indentation override for all JS under lib directory
   [lib/**.js]
   indent_style = space
   indent_size = 2

   # Matches the exact files either package.json or .travis.yml
   [{package.json,.travis.yml}]
   indent_style = space
   indent_size = 2
   ```

1. snyk

   [snyk](https://snyk.io/)

   Find and fix code vulnerabilities. JS projects have lots of dependencies. And those dependencies have dependencies. Any one of those may have vulnerablities.

   Snyk maintains a database of known vulnerabilities. You run your project past Snyk and it produces a report of your vulnerabilities.
