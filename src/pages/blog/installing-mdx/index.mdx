# Installing MDX and customizing it for moi.

I picked up this [blog post](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/09/build-blog-nextjs-mdx/) and went from there.

As is the case with a lot of <Tutorial>tutorials</Tutorial>, download from the sandbox and work backwards from there.

I then modified it by:
 - changing `post-n` to useful names - really not that hard
 - This example uses `<style jsx>` styling, which is new to me, so your milage may vary.
 - Created my first component in MDX. All exciting stuff
 - Converted it to Material-UI
